#### Q1: Fully-connected Neural Network (20 points) : Completed
The IPython notebook FullyConnectedNets.ipynb will introduce you to our modular layer design, and then use those layers to implement fully-connected networks of arbitrary depth. To optimize these models you will implement several popular update rules.

#### Q2: Batch Normalization (30 points) : Completed
In the IPython notebook BatchNormalization.ipynb you will implement batch normalization, and use it to train deep fully-connected networks.

#### Q3: Dropout (10 points) : Completed
The IPython notebook Dropout.ipynb will help you implement Dropout and explore its effects on model generalization.

#### Q4: Convolutional Networks (30 points) : Partially Completed
In the IPython Notebook ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb you will implement several new layers that are commonly used in convolutional networks.

#### Q5: PyTorch / TensorFlow on CIFAR-10 (10 points): Not Completed
For this last part, you will be working in either TensorFlow or PyTorch, two popular and powerful deep learning frameworks. You only need to complete ONE of these two notebooks. You do NOT need to do both, and we will not be awarding extra credit to those who do.

Open up either PyTorch.ipynb or TensorFlow.ipynb. There, you will learn how the framework works, culminating in training a convolutional network of your own design on CIFAR-10 to get the best performance you can.

NOTE: The PyTorch notebook requires PyTorch version 0.4, which was released on 4/24/2018. You can install this version of PyTorch using conda or pip by following the instructions here: http://pytorch.org/
